            <p1>Hello and welcome to my website on how the internet works. This site is a project for IS601 (Web Systems Development). I hope that this site provides you some general information that will further your understanding of what the internet is, and how it works. In this website you will learn about Domain Names, and the Organization known as ICANN that maintains the infrastructure and maintenance of them. You will also learn about how data is transported over networks through protocols, and you will also learn about the design of webpages. Below you will find some additional information and resources for better understanding the internet, including some fun facts if you missed it on the homepage.</p1>
