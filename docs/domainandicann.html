<h1>
    Domains and ICANN
</h1>
<h3>Domains</h3>
<p1> So what are domains? The definition of domain name is: the part of a network that identifies it as belonging to a particular domain. Why do we need it? Well just like the delivery of physical information like a letter, the sender needs a way to identify where the data needs to be transported to. In the case of physical mail, that is done through an address. Much like that, the internet solves this by way of domain names. A domain name is a unique name for an organization or person on the internet. The name gets combined with a generic top-level domain (gTLD). You are most likely familiar with .com or .org but there are actually many different kinds like .net or .io. These are actually managed by an organization named ICANN, which stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. </p1>


<h4> Example</h4>
<p1>An example of a domain name is (www.icann.org) </p1>




<h3>ICANN</h3>
<p1> Founded on September 18th, 1998, ICANN is a multi-stakeholder organization that coordinated and maintains the databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the internet. The organization is structured with a 16 member board of directors of which run the organization and employ the maintainers of the Central Internet Address pools and DNS root zone registries.</p1>
