<h1>
    HTTP and HTTPS
</h1>
<h3>HTTP</h3>
<p1> So what is HTTP? The definition of HTTP is: s an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. Though often based on a TCP/IP layer, it can be used on any reliable transport layer, that is, a protocol that doesn't lose messages silently like UDP does. RUDP — the reliable update of UDP — is a suitable alternative.</p1>


<h4> Example</h4>
<p1>Standard port: 80, can be seen as http://www.google.com</p1>




<h3>HTTPS</h3>
<p1> So what is HTTPS? The definition of HTTPS is: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.[1][2] In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL. </p1>
<h4> Example</h4>
<p1> Standard port: 443, can be seen as https://www.google.com</p1>
