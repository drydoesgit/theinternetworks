    DNS
</h1>
<h3>Domain Name System</h3>
<p1> So what is a Domain Name System? The definition of a Domain Name System is: is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. </p1>


<h4>Example</h4>
<p1>The earlier example of a domain name was (www.icann.org), the IP address for this domain names web server is 192.0.32.7 </p1>

<h4>Types of DNS to Load a Webpage</h4>

<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th scope="col">#</th>
        <th scope="col">Type</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">1</th>
        <td>DNS Recursor</td>
        <td>The DNS recursor is a server designed to receive queries from client machines through applications such as web browsers. Typically the recursor is then responsible for making additional requests in order to satisfy the client’s DNS query.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">2</th>
        <td>Root Nameserver</td>
        <td>The Root server is the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses. It can be thought of like an index in a library that points to different racks of books - typically it serves as a reference to other more specific locations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">3</th>
        <td>TLD Name Server</td>
        <td>The top level domain server (TLD) can be thought of as a specific rack of books in a library. This nameserver is the next step in the search for a specific IP address, and it hosts the last portion of a hostname (In example.com, the TLD server is “com”).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th scope="row">3</th>
        <td>Authoritative Name Server</td>
        <td>This final nameserver can be thought of as a dictionary on a rack of books, in which a specific name can be translated into its definition. The authoritative nameserver is the last stop in the nameserver query. If the authoritative name server has access to the requested record, it will return the IP address for the requested hostname back to the DNS Recursor (the librarian) that made the initial request.</td>
